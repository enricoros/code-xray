# Code XRAY - Web application
XRAYs a folder and shows the code in a nice looking
[Treemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping). This tool makes it intuitive to look at
new source code, such as a freshly cloned github repo, and understand what's going on at large.

You will see where (which folders) most of the work resides and be quickly able to
navigate the directory structure of the project. The #1 and Only metric used here is Lines
of Code (without blanks and comments) - for sure thee are more metrics, but this  works really well.


# Work in progress!
